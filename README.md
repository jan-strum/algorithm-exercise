# Overview

### Desscription

The following code was written in JavaScript, and tested with Mocha/Chai.

### Decisions

Although the provided description of each problem stated the type and content
of each function's argument(s), in order to account for invalid arguments, I
provided each function with a helper function, whose purpose is to validate the
arguments passed to it. I am aware that, to varying degrees, this comes at the
expense of performanceâ€”but, because these helpers can easily be removed, I
decided to include them here.
