# Overview

### Description

The following code was written in JavaScript, and tested with Mocha/Chai.

### Decisions

Although the provided description of each problem stated the type and content
of each function's argument(s), in order to account for invalid arguments, I
provided each function with a helper function, whose purpose is to validate the
arguments passed to it. I am aware that, to varying degrees, this comes at the
expense of performanceâ€”but, because these helpers can easily be removed, I
decided to include them here.

### Clarifications

In response the instruction #1 ("We expect that solutions are submitted with a
reference to the tools and technologies that Label Insight uses to help show
your competency for our teams"), beyond what is included in the "Description"
section above, I was not sure what was meant by "reference" in this instruction.
